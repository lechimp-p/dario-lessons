Understanding the What?! 
========================

In the first lesson we will dive into our given problem: the ToDo-Application.
We'll first try to understand what that thing is our project should achieve,
or, in programmer lingo: the specifications or requirements. 

You'll have some requirements, explicitly or implicitly, almost always when 
you're coding. You're most likely trying to solve some problem, right? So at 
least you should know what it is and when it's done. Sometimes requirements will
be given to you, sometime you need to write them down on your own. If the 
requirements aren't written down at least somewhere, this is the first thing you
should be doing.

The requirements come in many different forms. Only some of them are about what
you're code should actually be doing. There are more demands to your project:
deadlines, coding guidelines, the environment for deployment, choice of language,
framework or libraries, collaborators, version control, documentation, ...

Sometimes it's hard to judge whether a requirement is met, sometimes that is 
crystal clear. It's part of your task to understand the requirements. If someone
(even if it is you!) blaws some stuff about what your program should be doing, 
and you're not having at least a slight idea how you could meet the requirements:
ask. And write it down. And it's indeed a very delicate task to find out which 
requirements are essential and which are more accidental and how much details in 
the requirements are good for the project. Especially when you're coding for
someone who gives you money.

The requirements will be crucial in many ways during the project. They will be
the starting point for finding an appropriate architecture for your application.
You derive tests, whether manual or automated, from them. You need them for a
reliable communication with your customers or collaborators. They help you to 
stay focused on what the project is about. For all this, clear and precise
statements about the requirements are valuable.

So let's have a go:

* Create a file called REQUIREMENTS.md in this folder and put it under version
  control. When writing to it, format your text in markdown and remind yourself 
  of commiting it with meaningful messages at least whenever you made a self 
  consistent change. You should be doing this with every \*.md file (and almost
  all other files we'll be editing as well) from now on, but i will give you a
  reminder some times.
* Write down all requirements for the ToDo-Application i gave you so far in that
  file. Remind yourself that requirements could be given explicitly and implicitly.
  Push the stuff to the repo. I'll look at it, maybe add some things and push it 
  back. Watch the repo on github to get notified when i made my changes. 
* Write down your questions about the requirements. What do you need to know to
  feel confident about understanding the requirements? This is not about how you
  could implement the requirements, we'll get to that part later.
* Prepare yourself for a phone call with me. Make an appointment. Think about 
  the order in which we'll talk about your questions. Format the REQUIREMENTS.md
  accordingly. I'll like to look at it while we're telcoing. Prepare yourself
  for taking notes during the call. When the time comes, call me, ask questions,
  take notes. After the call we should both be confident that you'll write exactly
  the program i asked you for.
* Prepare the REQUIREMENTS.md file for it's future use as a memento to the 
  commitment on our project. That is: we should both be able to understand in
  in, say, half a year without doubt. We should both be able to point at it and
  say: 'yes, this requirement is met' or 'no, that one is not met' and actually 
  agree on this point. We should be able to use it as a reference in the process
  leading to a working piece of software. That means: format it, structure it, 
  turn it from a draft into a nice paper. You took notes in the previous step,
  right? Push your changes. Maybe we'll need to play some further ping pong with
  the file if i disagree with some contents.
