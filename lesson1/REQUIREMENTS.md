1.) Used Software

PHP 5.6.2
MySQL 5.1.73
Apache Webserver 2.2



2.) Intent

To plan, construct and install a to-do-list using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) setup.  

This project additionally aims on the learning progress and teamwork skills to be developed by Dario. 



3.) Features

The list is going to be accessible online and capable of handling multiple accounts for different people via a username-password system. An online database is going to store the necessary data. 
Its core capability is about arranging all kinds of subjects that the user wants to take care of. This arranging includes creating entries in the list, adding notes or features for every individual entry, possibly sorting the entries depending on i.e. the date it was created or a  catchword system (i.e. „school“, „job“, „household“ etc).
Optional possibilities are an appointment system which would further enable the list to remember the user of upcoming subjects via email, sms or a reminder on the list itself. Also sharing entries with other users would be a useful feature, so that it partly becomes a group list. This seems important in the case of working groups using the list, because they share their goals or depend on the completion of certain goals by other group members.
