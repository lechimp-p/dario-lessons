**1.** The first thing we ll need for sure is a :camel:

**2.** I d say the second most important thing (after the :camel:) is a space in the web where we can put down and use our *TDL*. We chose [uberspace] (http://boene.kochab.uberspace.de/TDL.html) as our webhost.

**3.** To build our *TDL* we need people (people = me, I guess) to be able to view the things that are to do, add new stuff and erase entrys from the list. Thats kinda saying:

> Gimme a pen `n a napkin buddy and I ll make ya a frikin to-do-list in notime!

This guy actually forgot to mention the rubber, but thats just because he had a couple too many drinks ...
Our digital pen, napkin and rubber will be php and html, coupled with MySQL, as far as I know.

My first question here is: Will Apache have to do anything with the *TDL*? Because it will run on uberspace and not my own computer. Do I have some missconception or was Apache "*just*" installed because its generally important and handy if you wanna work and develop stuff which is connected to the internet?

**4.** When it comes to deadlines, I d say you re obv the one that has to answer that requirement.

**5.** Making an appointment for a phone call reminds me of the fact that our only communication via text right now are SMS (and your girlfriends fb, which is kinda lame for everyone. or at least a little unprofessional) and they are costy. We can stay at SMS since they dont cost too much, but being the modern guys that we are, I think we can find a better way.
